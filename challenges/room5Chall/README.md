You are on a remote deserted island. 🏝

The sun is shining brightly in the sky, 🌞😎
You hear the waves crashing on the shore. 🌊
The birds are chirping on palm trees. 🐦🌴
A gentle breeze rolls past you. 💨

But then you realize:
You are stranded.

How are you going to get back home?
(Hint: a *change* of scenery might help)
