You are on a remote deserted island. 

The sun is shining brightly in the sky, 
You hear the waves crashing on the shore. 
The birds are chirping on palm trees. 
A gentle breeze rolls past you.

But then you realize:
You are stranded.

How are you going to get back home?
(Hint: a *change* of scenery might help)
